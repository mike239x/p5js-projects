# JavaScript Fun

Here I will store all my projects with javascript and p5js.
Most likely I will refactor lots of old code --- for example
I got some old completed Java projects with Applets (facepalm).

The repository contains:
1. Folder named `libs` with all libraries used.
2. A file called `server.sh` to host a simple local server,
 this requires Python3 to run.
 I don't know if it works on Windows.
3. `index.html` the main website containing links to project folders
 (currently under development).
4. Project folders.
5. `.gitignore` - includes folders `testing` and `SORT THIS`.

Inspired by The Coding Train YouTube channel.
