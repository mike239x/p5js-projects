# JavaScript Fun

Here I will store all my projects with javascript and p5js.
Most likely I will refactor lots of old code --- for example
I got some old completed Java projects with Applets (facepalm).

The repository contains:
1. Folder `libs` with all libraries used.
2. Folder `fonts` with a bunch of free fonts.
3. A file called `server.sh` to host a simple local server,
 this requires Python3 to run.
 I don't know if it works on Windows.
4. Project folders.
5. `.gitignore` - includes folders `testing` and `SORT THIS`.

Inspired by The Coding Train YouTube channel.

# GitHub Pages

This repo also has its own github page, meaning you can test provided javascript
apps just by going to
`https://mike239x.github.io/p5js-projects/the-folder-you-need`.
